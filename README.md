## üìù Environment Variables

Create `.env` files in both the `client` and `server` directories based on the following templates:

### `client/.env`
```dotenv
VITE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_YOUR_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
VITE_TMDB_IMAGE_BASE_URL=https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500 # For TMDB movie posters
VITE_CURRENCY=$ # Or your desired currency symbol
```

### `server/.env`
```dotenv
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/cinepass # Or your MongoDB Atlas connection string
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_YOUR_CLERK_SECRET_KEY
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_YOUR_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
TMDB_API_KEY=YOUR_TMDB_API_KEY # TMDB API Read Access Token (Bearer Token)
INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY=YOUR_INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY # From Inngest dashboard
INNGEST_EVENT_KEY=YOUR_INNGEST_EVENT_KEY # From Inngest dashboard
```

## üöÄ Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd CinePass
    ```

2.  **Install server dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd server
    npm install # or yarn install
    ```

3.  **Install client dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd ../client
    npm install # or yarn install
    ```

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Running the Application

1.  **Start the server:**
    ```bash
    cd server
    npm run server # This uses nodemon for development
    # Or for production: npm start
    ```

2.  **Start the client (in a new terminal):**
    ```bash
    cd client
    npm run dev # This starts the Vite development server
    ```

Your application should now be running on `http://localhost:5173` (or the port specified by Vite).

## üîë Admin Access

To grant admin access to a user:
1.  Log in to your Clerk Dashboard.
2.  Navigate to the "Users" section.
3.  Select the desired user.
4.  In their `Private Metadata`, add or update the `role` field:
    ```json
    {
      "role": "admin"
    }
    ```
5.  The user will gain admin privileges upon their next login or session refresh.

## ü§ù Stripe Webhook Setup (Crucial for Payments)

For a robust payment flow, you **must** set up a Stripe webhook. This ensures your backend is notified of successful payments and can update booking statuses and seat availability accordingly.

1.  **Deploy your backend:** Your webhook endpoint needs to be publicly accessible. During development, you can use a tool like `ngrok` to expose your local server.
2.  **Create a webhook endpoint in your `server`:** You'll need to define a new route (e.g., `/api/stripe-webhook`) that listens for Stripe events.
3.  **Implement webhook logic:** In this endpoint, verify the Stripe signature and handle the `checkout.session.completed` event to update `Booking.isPaid` to `true` and mark `Show.occupiedSeats`.
4.  **Configure in Stripe Dashboard:**
    *   Go to your Stripe Dashboard > Developers > Webhooks.
    *   Add a new endpoint, pointing to your public backend URL (e.g., `https://your-deployed-backend.com/api/stripe-webhook`).
    *   Select events to listen for: `checkout.session.completed` is essential. You might also want `checkout.session.async_payment_succeeded` and `checkout.session.async_payment_failed`.
    *   Stripe will provide a Webhook Secret; store this in your `server/.env` as `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
